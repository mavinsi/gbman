## ðŸš® Using

To create a repository of garbage, temporary or useless files type ``gbman create`` or ``gbman cr`` with that will be created a repository called ``gbdir`` (GarbageDirectory), in it you can add, clone in github repositories among other things that you will only use for a short period of time.
After you have done what you need and you no longer need the files you can type the command ``gbman clean`` or ``gbman cl`` and all your files that are inside the gbdi will be cleaned by the janitor, with this cleaning method the files can be recovered inside the /tmp/ folder of linux.
but if you want to permanently remove the files without needing linux to do it for you, should use ``gbman cleanforce`` or ``gbman clf`` and the files will be deleted directly without having to go through /tmp/
